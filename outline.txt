Text based racing game:

drivers have various stats. (experience, racecraft, awareness, pace)
    Experience – A higher experience score will help players collect a greater number of ‘Resource Points’, used in the game to buy car upgrades.

    Sneakiness – A higher racecraft score allow the driver to unleash more effective overtakes.

    Crashiness – A higher score here will mean the driver is less likely to lose control of their car when the going gets tough.

    Speed – Quite simply, the higher the pace score, the more rapid a driver will be throughout a race.


bonuses at various tracks based on their speeds or cornering

lap by lap selection of keep racing, pit for tires

chance of crashes, safety car means no passing
passing happens; per lap calculations and printing of current places

score poorly could result in getting fired
